develop a model that would analyze subscribers' behavior and recommend one of Megaline's newer plans

For a mobile carrier, Megaline, we want to develop a model that would analyze subscribers' behavior and recommend one of Megaline's newer plans: Smart or Ultra. We need to develop a model that will pick the right plan. We will try to develop a model with the highest possible accuracy. In this project, the threshold for accuracy is 0.75. We will check the accuracy using the test dataset.
